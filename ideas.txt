Saves locally (sqlite) by default. Add ability to store in online db.

How to display notes collection?
	Hotkey to bring a text input and type topic?
	
Should not allow to close the app with Enter if topic is missing...
	Or both content and topic?
	Allow exit only with Esc?

add cmd mode

restrict to 4 letter commands?

:exit
:show
:delete
:topics
:etc

the app has the potential to be something else... it could also be a generic text input that will send the text to whatever app you choose.
EXample:

this is a note that I have to send to Jeff:::sendto ms-teams

^^this would send the note to a chat in Teams.
